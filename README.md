# Metamorphosis Text Cleaning and Analysis

## Project Description

This project processes the text of *Metamorphosis* by Franz Kafka, downloaded from Project Gutenberg. The goal is to:

- Remove the Project Gutenberg header and footer
- Clean and normalize the text (remove punctuation, convert to lowercase, normalize whitespace)
- Split text into sentences and words
- Remove stop words
- Count and display the top 10 most frequent words

The project is a collaboration between two students, each contributing parts of the code as lambda functions.
